### Stock Price Prediction of Hyundai Using Adjusted Prices with RNN

### Overview:
This project focuses on predicting Hyundai's stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with adjusted stock prices, which account for dividends and stock splits. A Time Series Generator is used to process and prepare the data for training. The model is then trained to predict both inline (short-term) and outline (long-term) stock prices.

### Result:
The RNN model was used for both inline and outline predictions.

### Conclusion:
The project involves stock price prediction using RNN and adjusted prices, with predictions made for both short-term and long-term periods.
